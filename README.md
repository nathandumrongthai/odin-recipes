This is my first complete project in HTML.

In this project I will be learning how to use text elements combined with images and links. Overall, it should not be that hard or a project to do. However, I would like to get the most out of it.

After completing this project, I feel confident in knowing the html boilerplate, knowing how to write effective github commit messages. Furthermore, I will also learn how to publish my first website under git website.
