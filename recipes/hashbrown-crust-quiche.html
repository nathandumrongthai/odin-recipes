    <!-- STEPS -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place hash browns in a medium bowl. Melt 5 tablespoons butter and pour over hash browns, season with
            seasoning salt or garlic powder as desired. Add 1 egg, mix well and press mixture onto the bottom and sides
            of a 9-inch spring form pan or pie dish.</li>

        <li>Bake in preheated oven until potatoes are golden brown and crispy around the edges, about 25 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>While crust bakes, melt remaining tablespoon of butter in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham,
            pepper, and green onion; cook and stir until bell pepper slightly softens, about 4 minutes. Remove from
            heat.</li>
        <li>When crust is ready, spread ham mixture over the bottom; sprinkle cheese evenly on top. Whisk remaining 5
            eggs and cream in a medium bowl; add salt and pepper to taste and mix until well blended. Pour mixture
            evenly over ham and cheese mixture. </li>
        <li>Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.) Bake in the preheated oven until filling is puffed
            and quiche is lightly browned around the edges, about 35 minutes.</li>
